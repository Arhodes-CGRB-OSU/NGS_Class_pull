# Genome assembly - some basics

Short read assembly!

* [A short short-read assembly tutorial](https://github.com/ctb/2017-ucdavis-igg201b/blob/master/lab4/README.md) from CTB's IGG class at Davis.
* [Using SPAdes](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2015/assembling-ecoli.html) from ANGUS 2015 / Titus.
* [Nanopore assembly + short read](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2015/analyzing_nanopore_data.html) from ANGUS 2015 / Nick Loman.
* [More nanopore](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/analyzing_nanopore_data.html) from ANGUS 2016 / Lisa.

* [A tutorial by Shaun Jackman](http://sjackman.ca/abyss-activity/) from 2016 - this is a bit advanced for first impressions, and could be done in the second week, maybe.

I think we should plan on having 2-3 different tutorials.

* intro to assembly basics (takes in reads, outputs unannotated contigs)
* long read data (advantages/disadvantages)
* structural variation and assembly (maybe advanced only)
