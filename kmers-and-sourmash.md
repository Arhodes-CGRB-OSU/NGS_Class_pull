# Reference independent analyses with k-mers; comparing samples.

TODO:
* Talk about k-mers as central concept behind assembly etc; see [2015 tutorial](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2015/kmers-etc.html). K-mer abundance distributions etc. etc.
* Bring in some or all of https://sourmash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html

I think this is probably something for CTB to do :)
