# BWA and samtools and variant calling

Here we have two previous lessons:

* [Labs from CTB's 2017 IGG course at UC Davis](https://github.com/ctb/2017-ucdavis-igg201b/blob/master/lab2/README.md) (+ [using bedtools and more samtools](https://github.com/ctb/2017-ucdavis-igg201b/blob/master/lab3/README.md)).  There's also [a small homework exercise](https://github.com/ctb/2017-ucdavis-igg201b/blob/master/hw1/README.md).

* [the 2016 ANGUS tutorial](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/variant.html)

Proposal:
* merge some of the nice discussion from the 2016 tutorial with CTB's
materials from 2017;
* eliminate the Python code from CTB's materials until maybe later, and just use bedtools;
* use samtools too;
* maybe demo the [Artemis viewer](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis) at end. Probably too much to expect people to install it, and the VNC stuff with Jestream is ...challenging.
