# Introduction to automation

TODO: write me :)

Discuss:

* copy/pasting from a log book
* screen/tmux
* for loops and shell programming (take from Software Carpentry shell lesson)
* a first discussion of shell scripts (as opposed to R scripts)
* note that we have a more advanced discussion of this planned for Saturday.
