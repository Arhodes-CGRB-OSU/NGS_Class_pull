# Command-line and RStudio

This should be an overview and discussion of the previous three
lessons
([Running BLAST at the command line](running-command-line-blast.html),
[Running large scale BLASTs and output.](running-blast-large-scale.html),
[Visualizing BLAST score distributions in RStudio](visualizing-blast-scores-with-RStudio.html))
and what we did there, followed by running through details on shell.

* There were some thoughts on connecting to Data Carpentry / Software
  Carpentry shell lessons.
  
* Do we have an existing tutorial anywhere on RStudio Web as opposed to
  RStudio?
